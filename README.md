Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was a request from a stakeholder to create a system capable of online testing and driving practice. The system needed to be capable of allowing account creation, selection of packages, booking driving exams, practice online exams, and payment options. It also needed to be accessible to drivers to view schedules, and admin to maintain.





What did you do particularly well?

I was pleased with the class diagrams. All of the diagrams are easily understandable, but the class diagrams feel much closer to coding to me.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The Use case diagram was kind of messy and visually unappealing. I would probably go back and clean it up a little.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Took the notes from the product owners meeting with the stakeholders and created a system as true to form as possible. Although generally there are prototypes with further feedback aquired from the stakeholders. The users needs are the most important part of the system, its a product that is intending to be sold.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Copy cat. I think its foolish to attempt to reinvent the wheel. A lof of systems or concepts can be tweaked to the needs of the designer. Much in the same way I wouldnt waste the effort attempting to replace email if all I needed was an electronic form of communication for a small section of a project.
